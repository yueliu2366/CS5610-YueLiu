<h3>Week02 Experiment </h3>
<div>
    <h5>Experiment1-TemplateOfBootstrap</h5>
    <p>This experiment uses the Bootstrap Framework to implement an Responsive Navigation Bar which fixed at the top of the web page.
      Also, the Navigation Bar will fit to screen automatically when the size of screen is changed. Therefore, this page is suit for mobile users as well as PC users.

    <h5>Experiment2-CodeBox</h5>
    <p>
       In this experiment, I implement a code box which makes embedded code look pretty. It is a very useful experiment since code box is a 
        common piece of page of almost every experiment. I can easily megrate this code box to any other experiments so that code will be 
        easy to read.

    <h5>Experiment3-TestLayout</h5>
    <p>
       This experiment is based on the Experiment1-TemplateOfBootstrap. Here I implement a row of three columns by using Bootstrap classes, 
        which are col-sm-2, col-sm-6, col-sm-2. They sum up to 12, which is the same as what I did in previous experiments.

    <h5>Experiment4-TestTable</h5>
    <p>
      In this experiment, I replicate what Prof. did on class, which is table in bootstrap. By using table in bootstrap, I can immediately 
      build an relatively good UI without too much effort. Table is a very common element when you develop an website, it is worth a try.
       I also try a button in bootstrap and add a link to the button.
    </p>

    <h5>Experimen5-register</h5>
    <p>
       I try out <code>&lt;form&gt;, &lt;input&gt; </code> elements of bootstrap in this experiment. Input field can be found on login page.
       Also, this page is linked by the previous experiment when user click on the register button.
