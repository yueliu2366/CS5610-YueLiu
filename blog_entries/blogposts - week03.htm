<h3>Week03 Experiment </h3>
<div>
    <h5>Experiment1- DynamicArray</h5>
    <p>In this experiment, I try out two techniques: 1. Dynamic title 2. Dynamic Array.</p>
    <p>Both title and array will be modified dynamically after the html file is load. JQuery will bind with variable ul, then we can manipulate this object model in the JS file.</p>
</div>

    <h5>Experiment2- Passing Object </h5>
    <p>
        This experiment is based on experiment1, I try to pass a object from js file to html file. It is very common because
        we usually want to fetch data from database in JS file and then parse to html.
    </p>

    <h5>Experiment3-JQuery-drag,reorder,resize </h5>
    <p> In this experiment, I try the following in JQuery UI:</p>
    <p> -drag</p>
    <p> -reorder</p>
    <p> -resize</p>
    <p>
        These techniques can be used to design responsive page. Imaging we are developing a personal profile page,
        it is very common to add a field to describe skills that users have, and we also want these skills to be reorder in o
        rder to emphasize the top skill.

    <h5>Experiment4-LocalStorage</h5>
    <p>
        I try out adding a paragraph dynamically using JQuery UI. Meanwhile, I save objects to the localstorage and reload
        these objects after saving. Localstorage is similar to cookie but with larger space, which can be used to store temporary
        data.
    </p>

    <h5>Experimen5-Ajax</h5>
    <p>
        In this experiment, I use Ajax to fetch data from remote database and parse them in html without reloading the whole
        page. Ajax is a widely uesed technique in web2.0 development, of which we are able to recude the load of website.
