<h3>Week04 Experiment </h3>
<div>
    <h5>Experiment1- AngularJs-SimpleString</h5>
    <p>
        This is my first try out of AngularJS. In this experiment, I define a string <code>{{hello}}</code> in html page. Then I define
        a controller in js file. The UI and js file communicate with each other via a built-in variable called <code>$scope</code>.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h5>Experiment2- AngularJs-TrySomeObject</h5>
    <p>
        This experiment is based on the Experiment1- AngularJs-SimpleString. The <code>ng-controller</code> is still HelloWorldController.
        However I try to pass an object "employees" via <code> ng-repeat</code>. It is more common to pass object instead of just passing a
        string.
    </p>

    <h5>Experiment3-AngularJs-Add,Delete,Select</h5>
    <p>
      In this experiment, I try out some similar tests which were shown by Prof. Jose on the class. Although these experiments are similar to 
      what Prof. did on class, they are the key functions of almost websites nowadays. For instance, I will definitely need functions of adding,
        deleting and selecting a class when developing an course registration website.

    <h5>Experiment4-Add a Favorite movie</h5>
    <p>
       This experiment is also based on what Prof. Jose did on class. I implement a search bar firstly. The beauty of techonic behind this
        search bar is the <code>ng-model</code> and the <code>ng-click</code> fields. By defining these two attributes, I am able to bind 
        a variable and a function in html to the corresponding variable and function in js file. Besides, adding a favorite movie is the same
        as adding a movie which I achieved in previous experiment.

    <h5>Experimen5-Show details</h5>
    <p>
        Based on Experiment4-Add a Favorite movie, I add a button which enables users to see more information about some particular movies.
        When clicked, the button will invoke a function called "detailsMovie" in js file, this function will fetch detail information 
        via idIMDB and represent to html through <code>$scope.details</code>
    </p>
</div>
