<h3>Week08 Experiment </h3>
<div>
    <h5>Experiment1-JQuery- SlideDown</h5>
    <p>
        In this experiment, I try out jQuery slideDown() method. The jQuery slideDown() method is used to slide down an element. The optional speed parameter specifies the duration of the effect. It can take the following values: "slow", "fast", or milliseconds. The optional callback parameter is a function to be executed after the sliding completes.

    <h5>Experiment2-JQuery- SlideUp</h5>
<p>In this experiment, I try out jQuery slideToggle() method. The jQuery slideUp() method is used to slide up an element. The optional speed parameter specifies the duration of the effect. It can take the following values: "slow", "fast", or milliseconds. The optional callback parameter is a function to be executed after the sliding completes. </p> 
</div>

    <h5>Experiment3-JQuery- Toggle</h5>
    <p>
        In this experiment, I try out jQuery slideToggle() method. The method toggles between the slideDown() and slideUp() methods. If the elements have been slid down, slideToggle() will slide them up. If the elements have been slid up, slideToggle() will slide them down.
