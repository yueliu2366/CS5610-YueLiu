<h3>Week10 Experiment </h3>

    <h5>Experiment1-HomePage information List</h5>
<p>In this experiment, I build a page which shows a list of users' information. In addition, I add up two buttons at the end of each row. The first button is used to show more biography of this user when clicked. The seconde buttons is used to view full profile of this user when clicked. </p>    
</div>

    <h5>Experiment2-Service between pages</h5>
    <p>In this experiment, I start a service which provides methods to be called by any pages and supports globle variables between them. </p>
 
</div> 

<div>
    <h5>Experiment3-Ng-show && Service && Dynamically control web content</h5>
    <p>
        Based on the service, I add an "showMore" button which will drop down more biography information of the user. By setting up ng-show property, I am able to control whether or not the web content will be shown.  
    </p>

    <h5>Experiment4-Profile Page</h5>
    <p>
        In this experiment, I build a profile page which shows firsname, lastname, address and so on of the selected user. In addition, I add three buttons allowing users to send mail, edit profiles and go back to home page.   
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h5>Experimen5-Profile Page Pop Up View</h5>
    <p>
        In this experiment, I add the editing profile functionality. In order to do that, I use Button trigger modal in Bootstrap. By specifying data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" and class="modal fade" id="myModal" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myModalLabel" aria-hidden="true" The modal trigger and modal are bound.     </p>
